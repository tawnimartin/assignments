___This homework is due by 8am, on 01/29/2015___

1. Using the HTML in [octodex.html](./octodex.html), add CSS to make it look the same as [octodex.png](./_meta/octodex.png):

![](_meta/octodex.png)

* Create a new repo on github for this.

* Create a project github pages to host it.

# Deliverables

1. A link to the github repo

2. A link to the github pages for this

# Hard Mode

Use media queries to acheive the following effect on smaller screens:

  * Make the 3 primary images shrink to half the size

  * Hide the `by <images>` section under each image. (Keep the title)

# Nightmare Mode

Use CSS transitions, psuedo selectors and positioning to recreate the layout in the screenshot below:

![](_meta/tshirts.png)

**Note** Don't worry about the flipping effect. Focus on the layout and the flyout menus for the buttons below the shirts.
