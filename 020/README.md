___This homework is due by 8am, on 03/05/15___


## Homework

### Part 1

Refactor your employee grid from [yesterday's assignment](../019) to use `Backbone.Collection`.

### Part 2

  * __JavaScript Koans__

    * Head over [here](https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans) & Fork the project
    * Delete the existing `gh-pages` branch (do this on github)
    * Clone down your fork of it
    * Create a new `gh-pages` branch from master
    * Open the test suite at `KoansRunner.html`
    * Make all 53 Koans pass
    * Make sure to commit after each section so you don't loose any work

  * __Note:__ these tests are using [jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) not mocha/chai but the syntax is pretty close.

  * The underscore version included in `lib/underscore-min.js` is 4 years old and missing a lot of the features we have used to. I went through and solved it using the old underscore version that it comes with. However, feel free to update it.

## Deliverables

* Push to github and github pages (for both part 1 and 2).
* Comment on the issue assigned to you with:
  - link to your koans repo
  - link to the `KoansRunner.html` published on your github pages.
  - link to your new employee grid repo
  - link to employ grid on github pages
