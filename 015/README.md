___This homework is due by 8am, on 02/24/15___


## Homework

Clone the [intro-to-bdd](https://github.com/tiy-tpa-js-q1-2015/intro-to-bdd) repo. __Do not__ bother wiping out the `.git` and starting over. I want to be able to compare your changes from the starting point I have provided.

You will find 2 constructors in this project in the `js` folder called `foo` and `bar`. Foo is empty and Bar is already implemented.

__Part 1__

There is a spec (test) already in place for foo in `test/test.foo.js` but it is currently in the red. You need to implement the features on Foo to make it pass the tests.

__Part 2__

Bar is already implemented but has no tests. Write a test for every method on Bar. Put this in `test/test.bar.js`

__Part 3__

Write another blog post. You know the drill.


## Deliverables

* Push your repo to `gh-pages` and comment on the issue assigned to you with 3 links:
  - Link to github pages
  - Link to Repo
  - Link to your blog post

* All the specs for `Foo` should be passing and there should also be a passing test for every method on `Bar`.
