## Homework

### Part 1

Create a routed React app. This needs to use `Backbone.Router` and have 2 routes __pageone__ and __pagetwo__. On page one, it just needs to say _Page One_ and on page two, it just needs to say _Page Two_. The text needs to be rendered by react.

Do not worry about making this pretty or adding extra stuff. This is just an exercise in combining routes with react. If you get it done early, work on other assignments you are behind on.

### Part 2

Watch these 2 videos essays (each one is about ~5 mins):
