___This homework is due by 8am, on 02/03/15___

## Homework

1. Go to [medium.com](https://medium.com/) and sign up for a blog
  - If you already have a blog and you want to use it instead, that is fine.
2. Write a blog post about what you have learned, what you want to learn or just your take on where you are in general.
3. Take a brief look at [MDN's JavaScript Section](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and specifically, this [intro to JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript)
4. Open up the attached file `normal.js` and read through the exercises
5. Using the JS commenting syntax, put comments after each statement with the correct answer.
6. Create a repo on github called `JS-Intro` and push up the correct answers. The repo should contain the following

    * `Readme.md`
    * `.gitignore`
    * Completed `normal.js`

## Hard/Nightmare Modes

I have also prepared a hard.js and nightmare.js you can complete them the same way as the normal.js - They are optional.

## Deliverables

1. Post a comment on the issue assigned to you with a link to your blog post.
2. Post a comment on the issue assigned to you with a link to your repo containing the normal.js (and others if you did them.)
