// Consider the following code fragment

var a = "3";
var b = 2;
var c = b + a;


// Q: What is the value of c?


// Write to the best if your understanding
// why c is the value that it is.



var str = "Version " + 5 + 1;


// Q: What is the value of str?


// Write to the best if your understanding
// why str is the value that it is. How could
// it be altered to result in 6 instead of 51?
