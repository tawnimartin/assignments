## Homework

Create a Backbone model called `Employee`, Use it with the included [data.json](data.json) to build an employee grid.

The grid needs to have column headings for every property. The column headings bust be dynamic, meaning you must programmatically determine the headings of the grid based on the data once it is loaded.

Note the data is a JSON __array__, not an object, so you will need to load it using a regular Ajax request. Once you get the data you will need to iterate over it to create a model for each object.

Once you have an array of employee models, use them to create the grid. The grid can be any markup you want to use including a table, list items, divs, or definition lists.

Try to make the grid attractive.


### Hard Mode

Add a way to filter the grid. This can be something like a text input, or select box that lets you pick dept.


### Nightmare

Make the grid sortable by column.


## Deliverables

Push your grid to github and github pages and comment on the issue assigned to you with a link to both.
