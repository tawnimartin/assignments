  __Part 3.__ I would like you to also write another blog post about your first week with JavaScript. What did you learn, how do you feel about it, was it what you expected? I will be assigning a weekly blog post for each student to reflect on the week. If you do not want it public, feel free to make it private or use a pseudonym. I really enjoyed reading your blog posts last week and look forward to this weeks. I believe they gave me an insight into each of you that I did not get from class. If I really enjoy one of your blog posts (or if you talk about how great I am :bowtie:) I may ask if we can reblog it.


## Deliverables

1. Push to Github
2. Push to Github Pages
3. Comment on the assignment issued to you with links


## Go Further

  1. Create a new version of the clock, but this time actually convert it to a Hex clock. See `advanced.gif` screenshot below.
