___This homework is due by 8am, on 02/19/15___

## Homework

Copy the included `constructors.js` to a new project. Add an index.html that includes it. Answer all the questions and upload to __gh-pages__.

Keep in mind in the examples in `constructors.js`
I need to be able to test them in __gh-pages__ on the
console. Also make sure there are no javascript errors
and check your code in [js hint](http://jshint.com/). Finally make sure it
is formatted/indented correctly. Code is in place
that validates each answer. It will currently say:
`Assertion failed` for each question. Once you answer
the question correctly that will go away. Use this to
check your work.

## Deliverables

* Push to gh pages.
* Comment on the issue assigned to you with a link to your repo and a link
to your gh-pages.
