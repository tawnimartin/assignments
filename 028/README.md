___This homework is due by 8am, on 03/25/15___


## Homework

Create an app that has the following criteria:

* has different routes
* has persisted data
* has users, the ability to login and register a new account
* has data associated with a user and shows the user's data when logged in.

You can use Backbone.View or React or both. Whichever you prefer.

Use this as a learning exercise for your final app. If you already have an idea for your final app, this could be a rough draft or prototype.

You have 6 days to complete this app and this will be your last homework assignment. We may not have covered everything you need yet to complete a fully functioning user registration. Get as much done as you can and complete the missing pieces next week as we learn more. Use your time wisely, if you are stuck, take a break and maybe work on other assignments. Try your best to get caught up as much as you can before we start final projects so that is not a weight on your shoulders.


## Deliverables

Push to github, deploy to github pages and comment on issue assigned to you with links to both.
